# Signature Programs

![Filler Header Image](https://liberty-sa.terradotta.com/_customtags/ct_Image.cfm?Image_ID=35684){.header}

Signature Study Abroad programs are Christian programs designed for Liberty students to travel together in a cohort model. Students will grow and mature in their faith through intentional Christian community, service, and discipleship, as well as engage in academics taught through biblical worldview and cultural engagement. 

In these programs, students pay a set program fee based on location, Liberty University tuition, and the LU Send study abroad fee. Please note that each signature program is carefully designed to create a similar residential experience, and each program cost is determined in the University's agreement with each partner organization.  Each program's cost includes room and board, excursions, and other student services determined by each program. For more information on the study abroad fee, please refer to _"Study Abroad and Internship Fees"_ on the [Policies & Guidelines]({{ link('policies') }}) page.
